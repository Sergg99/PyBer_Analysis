# PyBer_Analysis
Week-5 Challenge
  
## Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis consists of creating several visualization types about PyBer, a Python-based ridesharing app company. The following analysis contains a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type, fares by city, rides per city, rides per driver, and more. Using Python, the analysis was able to incorporate multiple databases into the following analysis.

- Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)


## Resources: 
- Python 3.9.7
  - Pandas
  - matplotlib
- Visual Studio Code 1.72.2
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
- Data Source: 
  - city_data.csv
  - ride_data.csv

## Results:
- Deliverable 1: Get a Summary DataFrame

    - As seen above, the results include the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver in all three types of cities.
    - In this data frame, we can observe that Urban Cities have a larger margin in profits due to the immense amount of drivers available to offer the service. While on the other side, we can see Rural Cities have the smallest margin of earnings due to the little demand for the ridesharing app.

- Another aspect indicates that in late February and the beginning of March, Urban cities had the overall highest points in the period shown above, showing the increased demand at the time. While on the beginning of the year, January, all types of cities were showing their lowest earning periods. 

## Summary:

- Rural cities accounted for the least amount of fares and rides among all types of cities. Although, their average fare per ride accounts for the highest of all city types, this suggests that people do not ride with frequency but when they do, the rides are worth the wait. 
- Suburban cities account for the middle amount of fares and rides among all city types, showing that there is potential of growth if the right investments present themselves. 
- Urban cities have the highest total fare and the most amount of rides from all city types, accounting for most of the revenue for PyBer. They should stay closely monitored in order to improve the ride experience and attract more clients, with these proper tools of analysis, a deeper analysis could help decipher key aspects in which PyBer can remain successful.
